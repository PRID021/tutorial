            A tech aficionado from PhuRieng, born in '92. UIT University honed
            my skills in Dart, Kotlin, Swift, and Python. Two years in mobile
            development taught me the art of crafting user-friendly apps, while
            a year in backend development solidified my Python prowess. Eager
            for innovation, I ventured into the cloud with Google Cloud, AWS.
            Today, I stand as a digital pioneer, driven by curiosity and a
            thirst for pushing boundaries. With each project, I strive to
            redefine the limits of technology, leaving a lasting impact on the
            world of software engineering.
